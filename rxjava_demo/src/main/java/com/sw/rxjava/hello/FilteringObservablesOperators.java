   Filtering Observables
Operators that selectively emit items from a source Observable.

Debounce — only emit an item from an Observable if a particular timespan has passed without it emitting another item
Distinct — suppress duplicate items emitted by an Observable
ElementAt — emit only item n emitted by an Observable
Filter — emit only those items from an Observable that pass a predicate test
First — emit only the first item, or the first item that meets a condition, from an Observable
IgnoreElements — do not emit any items from an Observable but mirror its termination notification
Last — emit only the last item emitted by an Observable
Sample — emit the most recent item emitted by an Observable within periodic time intervals
Skip — suppress the first n items emitted by an Observable
SkipLast — suppress the last n items emitted by an Observable
Take — emit only the first n items emitted by an Observable
TakeLast — emit only the last n items emitted by an Observable
